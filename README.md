# Land of the Rair Community Mods

Want to contribute to the Land of the Rair Community Mods? You're in the right place!

## Adding a Mod

You should first follow the setup instructions on the [Modkit Usage page](https://rair.land/docs/modkit/) to get up and running. Once you're satisfied with your mod, and it's tested, you can contribute it by sending a pull request to add your mod. 

Just because a mod is in this repository does _not_ mean it's live! It's intended to have this be a place where mods can be tested and reviewed before they're added to the Land of the Rair.

Keep in mind that it must be the `.rairmod` file, not the `.rairdevmod` file.
